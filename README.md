# AARegrade
Archeage regrade simulation tool.

This software is an open source tool that will allow you to emulate and simulate regrades using 3.5 values, only without actually spending your gold!

1. Perform actual regrades as if you were in game!
2. Perform simulated iterations from one grade to another, altering prices and supplies as you see fit.
3. Use this tool to better learn how to use your gold in game!

I am always open to ideas, and with more and more visitors and downloads each day, I hope this will turn into a wonderful tool to use alongside our favorite game, ArcheAge!
